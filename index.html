                <p>
                    After a devastating flood in early June that affected around 4 million residents, the same area was
                    hit
                    again with record-breaking rainfall that began on June 15. Most of the Sylhet city has gone
                    underwater
                    again, with water continuing to rise, worsening the condition of those still living in temporary
                    shelters and further exposed to extreme weather and waterborne diseases.

                    However, further support from charitable organizations and development partners is still desperately
                    needed. The need for rescue and relief intensifies as days pass in the flood-affected areas. A
                    coordinated humanitarian response will greatly complement Governmentâ€™s efforts to ensure that the
                    most
                    vulnerable communities receive targeted humanitarian assistance.
